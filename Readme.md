# Goal: Learning Rust

I'm currently learning rust language for general purpose.
Rust is awesome because right now I'm digging in it further.
It's really awesome language, if we try to understand it.
People run away from it's memory safety features.
Borrow checking is like checking whether borrowed thing is returned or not before actual thing gets drop.
Ownership just says that only one owner at the time, so we don't have dangling ref to broken memory which is already freed and no longer exists.

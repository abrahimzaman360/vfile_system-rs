# Goal: Learning Rust

- I'm currently learning rust language for general purpose.
- Rust is awesome because right now I'm digging in it further.
- It's really awesome language, if we try to understand it.
- People run away from it's memory safety features.
- Borrow checking is like checking whether borrowed thing is returned or not before actual thing gets drop.
- Ownership just says that only one owner at the time, so we don't have dangling ref to broken memory which is already freed and no longer exists.

## Current Progress:

- basics is going on like, types (u64, u32, i16, u8, usize, isize, i8, i16, i32, i64, f32, f64, String, &str)
